# Ideas
- Monsters the size of Zorah Magdalos, Lao-Shan, etc. should be featured in a KT-siege like game mode.
    - Reward level goes up with part breaks and sub-objectives.
    - The higher the reward level the higher the quantity and quality.
    - Max reward levels per party
        - 1 Party = 35% reward level
        - 2 Parties = 50% reward level (standard rate)
        - 3 Parties = 70% reward level
        - 4 Parties = 100% reward level
    - Reward level 100% should give special materials, like tickets to craft aesthetic gear.
- Semi-RNG weapons like KT's relic weapons.
